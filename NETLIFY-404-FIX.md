# ðŸš¨ SvelteKit + Netlify 404 Fix

## The Problem
Your site built successfully but returns 404 for all pages because the SvelteKit Netlify adapter creates a serverless function, not static files.

## The Solution
1. **Remove the catch-all redirect** - The adapter handles routing automatically
2. **Let the adapter do its job** - Don't redirect `/*` to `/index.html`

## Correct _redirects File
```
# API Routes
/api/*  /.netlify/functions/:splat  200

# Custom redirects
/search  /marketplace/search  301

# NO CATCH-ALL REDIRECT!
# The adapter handles all other routes automatically
```

## Why This Happens
- SvelteKit with Netlify adapter creates a **server-side rendered** app
- There's no `index.html` - everything runs through a serverless function
- The adapter sets up its own routing - we don't need to redirect everything

## Checking Deploy Status
After pushing the fix:
1. Check Netlify dashboard for build status
2. Look for "Deploy published" message
3. Clear browser cache and try again

---
*Note: The Netlify adapter creates `.netlify/functions/sveltekit-render` to handle all routes*
