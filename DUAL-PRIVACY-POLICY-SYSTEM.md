*(What users actually read)*

### We Keep It Simple

**What we collect:**

- Payment info (but Stripe handles that, not us)
- Which components you look at (to make better recommendations)

**What we don't do:**
- Track you around the web
- Sell your email to anyone  
- Spam you with marketing BS

**What we do:**
- Send purchase confirmations (obviously)
- Notify you about major updates (rarely)
- Keep your data secure and private

**Your control:**
- Delete your account anytime ‚Üí email us
- Download your purchase history ‚Üí email us  
- Stop emails ‚Üí click unsubscribe

**Questions?** Email us. We're humans, not robots.
