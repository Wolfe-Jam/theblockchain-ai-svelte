# 🔧 API Route Not Deployed - FIXED!

## ✅ **Problem Identified & Solution**

**The Issue**: The `/api/stripe/create-payment-intent` endpoint was returning 404 because:
- `netlify.toml` was configured for custom functions directory
- SvelteKit API routes weren't being compiled as Netlify functions
- Conflict between manual functions config and SvelteKit adapter

**The Fix**: 
- ✅ **Updated netlify.toml** to let SvelteKit adapter handle functions
- ✅ **Added debugging** to API route with GET endpoint
- ✅ **Enhanced error logging** for better troubleshooting

---

## 🚀 **Deploy the Fix**

Since GitHub has branch protection rules, you have **2 options**:

### **Option A: Netlify Manual Deploy (Fastest)**
1. **Netlify Dashboard** → **Deploys** → **"Trigger deploy"**
2. **Select**: "Clear cache and deploy site"  
3. **Wait**: 3-4 minutes for build completion
4. **Test**: API should work after deploy

### **Option B: Create Pull Request**
1. **Create branch**: `git checkout -b fix-api-deployment`
2. **Push branch**: `git push origin fix-api-deployment`
3. **Create PR** in GitHub from the branch
4. **Merge PR** to trigger auto-deploy

## 🧪 **Test After Deploy**

### **Step 1: Test API Endpoint Directly**
```bash
# Test if API exists (should return JSON, not HTML)
curl https://theblockchain.ai/api/stripe/create-payment-intent

# Expected response: {"message": "API route is working!", "timestamp": "..."}
```

### **Step 2: Test Live Payment**
1. **Go to**: [https://theblockchain.ai/marketplace/demo/nobs-pay/](https://theblockchain.ai/marketplace/demo/nobs-pay/)
2. **Select**: $1 NOBS Pay Test
3. **Toggle**: LIVE mode (red indicator)
4. **Try payment**: Should work without "Unexpected token" error

## 🔍 **What Changed**

### **Before (Broken)**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && cd netlify/functions && npm install && cd ../.. && npm run build"
  functions = "netlify/functions"  # ← This broke SvelteKit API routes
```

### **After (Fixed)**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  # Let SvelteKit adapter handle functions automatically
```

### **Enhanced API Route**
- ✅ **Added GET endpoint** for testing
- ✅ **Better error logging** shows environment variables
- ✅ **Debug output** helps troubleshoot issues

---

## 📊 **Expected Results After Deploy**

### **API Test**
```bash
curl https://theblockchain.ai/api/stripe/create-payment-intent
# Response: {"message": "API route is working!", "timestamp": "2025-07-13T12:30:00.000Z"}
```

### **Live Payment Test**
- ✅ **Payment form loads** without errors
- ✅ **"Processing payment"** state works
- ✅ **Success/failure** messages display properly
- ✅ **Transactions appear** in Stripe dashboard

---

## 🚨 **If Still Not Working After Deploy**

### **Check Deploy Logs**
1. **Netlify** → **Deploys** → Click latest deploy
2. **Deploy log** → Look for function compilation
3. **Should see**: "Functions compiled" or similar

### **Test API Endpoint**
```bash
# If this returns HTML (404 page), functions still not working
curl https://theblockchain.ai/api/stripe/create-payment-intent

# If this returns JSON, API is working
```

### **Check Function Logs**
1. **Netlify** → **Functions** tab
2. **Should see**: `create-payment-intent` function listed
3. **Click function** → View logs for debugging

## 🎯 **Root Cause Explained**

**SvelteKit Adapter vs Manual Functions**:
- ✅ **SvelteKit adapter**: Automatically converts API routes to Netlify functions
- ❌ **Manual functions config**: Told Netlify to ignore SvelteKit functions
- 🔧 **Conflict**: Netlify looked in wrong directory for functions

**File Structure**:
```
src/routes/api/stripe/create-payment-intent/+server.ts
↓ (SvelteKit builds this into)
.netlify/functions-internal/create-payment-intent.js
```

**The fix**: Let SvelteKit handle this automatically instead of overriding with manual config.

---

## ✅ **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the fix** (Option A or B above)
2. **Test API endpoint** with curl
3. **Test live payment** on website
4. **Verify $1 transactions** in Stripe dashboard

**This should completely resolve the "Unexpected token" error!** 🎉

The API route will be properly deployed as a Netlify function and your live payments should work perfectly.
