# LaTeX Compilation Options

Since the local LaTeX installation seems incomplete, here are your options:

## Option 1: Fix Local Installation
```bash
# In your terminal, run:
eval "$(/usr/libexec/path_helper)"

# Then try:
which pdflatex

# If still not found, you may need to:
# 1. Restart your terminal
# 2. Or reinstall MacTeX with sudo:
sudo brew reinstall --cask mactex
```

## Option 2: Use Online Compiler (Fastest)
1. Go to https://www.overleaf.com
2. Create free account
3. New Project â†’ Blank Project
4. Copy content from: convergent-economy-latex.tex
5. Click "Recompile"

## Option 3: Use Simplified Version
The simplified version (convergent-economy-simplified.tex) has fewer dependencies and might work with a partial installation.

## Option 4: Use Docker
```bash
# If you have Docker installed:
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/data -w /data texlive/texlive pdflatex convergent-economy-simplified.tex
```

## File Locations:
- Full version: `/Users/wolfejam/theblockchain-ai-svelte/convergent-economy-latex.tex`
- Simplified: `/Users/wolfejam/theblockchain-ai-svelte/convergent-economy-simplified.tex`

## Quick Test
Once LaTeX is working, test with:
```bash
cd /Users/wolfejam/theblockchain-ai-svelte
pdflatex convergent-economy-simplified.tex
```
