# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: SvelteKit + Netlify SSR Fix

## The Problem
Your site returns 404 because SvelteKit with Netlify adapter creates a **server-side rendered** app, not a static site.

## The Solution
The `_redirects` file should **NOT** have any catch-all redirect. The adapter automatically adds:
```
* /.netlify/functions/sveltekit-render 200
```

## Correct _redirects File
```
# API Routes
/api/*  /.netlify/functions/:splat  200

# Custom redirects
/search  /marketplace/search  301

# Production domain redirects  
https://bai.vercel.app/*  https://theblockchain.ai/:splat  301!

# NO CATCH-ALL REDIRECT HERE!
# The adapter adds it automatically
```

## Why This Works
1. **SvelteKit SSR** - All routes are handled by a serverless function
2. **Adapter Magic** - Automatically appends the catch-all redirect during build
3. **No Conflicts** - Our redirects + adapter's redirect = working site

## Testing Locally
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
# Visit http://localhost:4173
```

## Key Difference: SSR vs SPA
- **SPA (Static)**: `/* â†’ /index.html`
- **SSR (SvelteKit)**: `/* â†’ /.netlify/functions/sveltekit-render`
