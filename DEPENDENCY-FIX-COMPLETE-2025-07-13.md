**Date**: July 13, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **WORKING DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT RESTORED**

---

## 🚨 **WHAT WENT WRONG**

### **The Breaking Update**
```bash
npm audit fix --force  # ← This caused major breaking changes

# What it broke:
@sveltejs/kit: 2.0.0 → 0.0.30     # Wrong version!
vite: 5.4.10 → 6.3.5              # Major version jump
@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte: 3.0.0 → 5.1.1  # Svelte 5 tooling!
# But svelte stayed at: 4.2.0     # Svelte 4!

Result: Svelte 5 tooling + Svelte 4 code = 💥
```

### **Symptoms**
- **Peer dependency conflicts**
- **13 vulnerabilities** (including 4 critical)
- **Dev server issues**
- **Build failures**
