# Form Submission 405 Error Fix

## üîç Problem
The download form was getting a 405 (Method Not Allowed) error because it was trying to POST to the root URL `/`, which doesn't accept POST requests in the SSR setup.

## üîß Solution
1. **Updated form submission URL**: Changed from `/` to `/api/form-handler`
2. **Changed data format**: From form-encoded to JSON
3. **Added handler**: Added `convergent-economy-download` case to the Netlify function

## üìù Changes Made

### `/src/routes/download/+page.svelte`
```javascript
// Before:
const response = await fetch('/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
  body: new URLSearchParams(formData).toString()
});

// After:
const response = await fetch('/api/form-handler', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    formName: 'convergent-economy-download',
    email: email,
    format: formatChoice,
    source: 'dedicated-download-page',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
});
```

### `/netlify/functions/form-handler.js`
Added new case for download form submissions to handle email notifications.

## üéØ Key Learning
When migrating from static to SSR, form submissions that used Netlify's form handling (POST to `/`) need to be updated to use API endpoints instead.
