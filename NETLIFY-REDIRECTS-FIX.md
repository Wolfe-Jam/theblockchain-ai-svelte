# 🚀 Netlify Build Fix - Part 2

## 🎯 Issue Fixed: Redirect Configuration

### ❌ **The Error**
```
Error: Redirects are not supported in netlify.toml. Use _redirects instead.
```

### 🔧 **What Changed**
1. **Removed redirects from netlify.toml** - SvelteKit adapter doesn't support them there
2. **Created static/_redirects** - Proper location for SvelteKit projects
3. **Created static/_headers** - Moved headers to proper location
4. **Cleaned up root directory** - Removed duplicate _redirects and _headers files

### 📁 **File Structure (Correct)**
```
theblockchain-ai-svelte/
├── static/
│   ├── _redirects    ✅ (Netlify reads from here after build)
│   └── _headers      ✅ (Netlify reads from here after build)
├── netlify.toml      ✅ (No redirects, just build config)
└── build/            (Generated during build)
```

### 🎨 **Designer Analogy**
Think of it like this:
- **netlify.toml** = Blueprint for construction (how to build)
- **static/_redirects** = Signage plan (where visitors go)
- **static/_headers** = Security plan (safety rules)

The builder (SvelteKit adapter) only wants construction details in the blueprint, not the signage!

### ✅ **Ready to Deploy**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix: Move redirects from netlify.toml to static/_redirects"
git push
```

### 📝 **Note About Warnings**
The build logs show some warnings about unused exports in NOBSPay components - these are just warnings and won't prevent deployment.

*Fixed for SvelteKit + Netlify compatibility*
