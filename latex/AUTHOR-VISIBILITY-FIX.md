# Fix for PDF Author Visibility on Title Page

## Problem
The authors are being hidden "under" the network visualization graphic on the PDF front page.

## Solution
Move the network visualization higher up on the page to ensure authors are clearly visible in the bottom half.

## Changes Required in `convergent-economy.tex`

### Find this section (around line 145-150):
```latex
% Enhanced network visualization with brand colors
\begin{scope}[shift={($(current page.center)+(0,3)$)}]
```

### Replace with:
```latex
% Enhanced network visualization with brand colors - moved higher
\begin{scope}[shift={($(current page.north)+(0,-8)$)}]
```

This changes the position from "3cm above center" to "8cm below the top", which will place the network graphic in the upper third of the page.

## Alternative Solution (if the above creates too much space)

### Option 1 - Moderate adjustment:
```latex
\begin{scope}[shift={($(current page.center)+(0,6)$)}]
```
This moves it 6cm above center instead of 3cm.

### Option 2 - Scale down the graphic:
```latex
\begin{scope}[shift={($(current page.center)+(0,3)$)}, scale=0.8]
```
This keeps the position but makes the graphic 20% smaller.

## Additional Improvements

To make the author section more prominent, you can also:

1. **Increase the spacing before authors:**
   Change `\\[2cm]` after the subtitle to `\\[3cm]`

2. **Add a background box for authors:**
   ```latex
   % Author and Organization Attribution
   \begin{tcolorbox}[
       width=0.9\textwidth,
       colback=white,
       colframe=ocean!50,
       boxrule=1pt,
       arc=5pt
   ]
       \centering
       {\large\bfseries\color{ocean} 
        Lead Author: James Harrison}\\[0.2cm]
       {\color{darkgray} 
        Wolfe James LLC \& theBlockchain.ai Founding Team}\\[0.5cm]
       {\color{darkgray} Published: July 2025}
   \end{tcolorbox}
   ```

This will put the authors in a subtle box that ensures they stand out from any background graphics.

## Quick Test
After making changes, rebuild the PDF:
```bash
cd /Users/wolfejam/theblockchain-ai-svelte/latex
pdflatex convergent-economy.tex
```

Then check if the authors are now clearly visible in the bottom half of the title page.
